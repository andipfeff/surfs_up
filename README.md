# Surf's Up Analysis

For this part of the Challenge, write a report that describes the key differences in weather between June and December and two recommendations for further analysis.

The analysis should contain the following:

1. Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
2. Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
3. Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
